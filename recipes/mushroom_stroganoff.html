    <h3>Description</h3>

    <p>There's a reason this recipe is one of the most popular recipes on my blog.  It's easy, fast, and satifsying to the point where it's almost mind-blowing that this chunky, creamy, and flavor-loaded dish is made entirely from plants.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
       <li>1 small yellow onion</li>
       <li>10 ounces cremini mushrooms</li>
       <li>4 cups rotini, or pasta of choice</li>
       <li>4 cups vegetable broth</li>
       <li>2 tbsp nutritional yeast</li>
       <li>1/4 tsp black pepper</li>
       <li>1/3 cup cashew butter</li>
       <li>1 tbsp fresh lemon juice</li>
       <li>Salt</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>

    <ol>
        <li>Peel the onion, cut it in half and then thinly slice it into half "rings".  Clean the mushrooms using a damp paper towel or cloth, then cut them in half or quarters, depending on their size.  You want to keep the mushrooms relatively large, as they will shrink when cooking and are meant to imitate beef in this recipe.</li>
        <li>Heat a large pot over medium heat; when it's warm, add 1/4 cup water and the onion; cook until the onion is translucent, 3 to 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add the mushrooms, pasta, broth, nutritional yeast, and pepper, stirring well.  Bring to a boil over high heat, then reduce the heat to medium and simmer for 10 to 15 minutes, stirring occasionally to ensure nothing sticks to the bottom of the pan.</li>
        <li>Remove from the heat, then stir in the cashew butter and lemon juice.  Taste the pasta and add salt and pepper to taste, if necessary.  Transfer to serving bowls and top with parsley.  Serve warm; leftovers will keep in the fridge for up to 5 days.</li>
    </ol>
