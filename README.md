Project: Recipes for The Odin Project

In this project I will showcase my use of HTML code to build a recipe page.
This page will not be pretty but it will be structured correctly using semantic HTML.
While I do already know a fair amount of HTML at this point after using freeCodeCamp.org, this project will be an interesting exercise.
I haven't done anything in pure HTML in some time, having relied heavily on CSS to style the page.
Let's see how this turns out for me here.  I'm not sure this will be the greatest thing that I've ever done.
